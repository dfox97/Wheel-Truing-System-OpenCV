Wheel truing system image processing team - we measured the buckle and ovality of a bike wheel to determine truing using OpenCV and C++.


Group project Split into 3 teams we focused on the softrware design for image processing


using openCV C++ and raspberry pi 3 with cameras to track buckle and ovality of bike wheel



Setup - We used white paper to filter the noise and make the histogram clear
